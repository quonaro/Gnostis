# Gnostis

A local "second brain" for developers. Gnostis indexes your projects with tree-sitter-aware chunking, stores embeddings locally, and exposes semantic search tools to AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What it does

- Watches configured directories and incrementally indexes changed files.
- Splits code into symbol-level chunks (functions, types, methods, classes).
- Stores embeddings locally using `chromem-go`.
- Answers semantic search queries from Cursor/Windsurf via MCP tools.
